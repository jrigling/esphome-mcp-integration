"""Direct-to-device log streaming over the ESPHome native API.

Bypasses the ESPHome dashboard entirely - so it works whether the add-on runs
the classic dashboard or the new Device Builder - by connecting to a device's
native API (port 6053) with ``aioesphomeapi`` and subscribing to its log stream
for a bounded window.

``aioesphomeapi`` is imported lazily and kept out of the package's hard
dependencies: Home Assistant already ships a pinned copy, and pinning our own
could conflict with it. Inside HA it is always available.
