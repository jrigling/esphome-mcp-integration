# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Two deliverables from one repo, mirroring the `python-jebao` / `homeassistant-jebao` split:

1. **`esphome_mcp_client/`** — a pure-Python async transport library (no Home Assistant imports), published to PyPI as **`esphome-mcp-client`**.
2. **`custom_components/esphome_mcp_bridge/`** — a Home Assistant custom integration (domain `esphome_mcp_bridge`) that registers a custom LLM API. It depends on the client via `manifest.json` `requirements` (exact `==` pin).

The integration exposes a full ESPHome dev cycle to AI agents via HA's MCP server: discover add-ons → inventory devices → read/create/write YAML → validate → compile → upload/run → logs → clean.

## Commands

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"              # install client lib + dev tooling
ruff check esphome_mcp_client tests  # lint
pytest                               # run all tests
pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -k inventory   # single test
python -m build && twine check dist/*         # verify packaging
```

Tests use `aioresponses` to mock HTTP; they cover the client library only (no HA test harness here).

## Architecture

`esphome_mcp_client` is transport-only and HA-agnostic so it can be unit-tested and reused:

- `supervisor.py` — `SupervisorClient`: discovers ESPHome add-ons via `GET /addons` (matches any slug/name containing `esphome`), ranks them stable > beta > dev (running preferred), and resolves how to reach each add-on's dashboard via `async_dashboard_target` (from `GET /addons/{slug}/info`). Preferred path is the **Supervisor ingress proxy** (`http://supervisor/ingress/<token>/…`, token = last segment of `ingress_entry`), because the new Device Builder peer-guards its ingress port to loopback + Supervisor only — direct `hostname:ingress_port` access 403s. `open_dashboard_connection` mints a per-call `ingress_session` cookie via `POST /ingress/session`. Falls back to direct `hostname:ingress_port` (port 6052 default) for add-ons without ingress.
- `dashboard.py` — `DashboardClient`: talks the **legacy** ESPHome dashboard protocol. REST for `/devices`, `/ping`, `/edit`, `/json-config` (still used for inventory + config read/write); WebSocket "spawn" protocol for `/compile|/upload` (and `/validate|/clean|/run|/logs`, which exist only on a classic dashboard).
- `ws_client.py` — `WsClient`: the new Device Builder **multiplexed `/ws`** command API that replaced the per-operation spawn endpoints. Sends `CommandMessage {command, message_id, args}`, demuxes `Event`/`Result`/`Error` frames by `message_id`. Build ops (`firmware/compile|upload|clean`) submit a job then `firmware/follow_job` to stream output; stream ops (`devices/validate|logs`) stream directly. Pre-authenticated on the trusted ingress site. The integration's `_BuildClient` (in `llm.py`) runs build/stream tools on `WsClient`, falling back to `DashboardClient`'s legacy spawn only when `/ws` is absent (`WsUnavailableError` = classic dashboard). Inventory (`/devices`) and config (`/edit`) still ride the legacy REST for now.

The integration's `llm.py` wraps the client in `llm.Tool` subclasses. `async_setup_entry` registers `ESPHomeBuilderAPI` and ties the returned unregister callback to the entry via `entry.async_on_unload`. Installation is UI-only: a confirm-only, single-instance config flow (`config_flow.py`) — there is no YAML setup and no `async_setup`.

## Critical protocol facts (verified against ESPHome + Device Builder source)

- There is **no `/api/v1/jobs` REST endpoint** (an early spec assumed one). Compile/logs/etc. are **WebSocket**, spawn protocol:
  - client → `{"type": "spawn", "configuration": "x.yaml", "port": "OTA"}`
  - server → `{"event": "line", "data": "<chunk>"}` repeated, then `{"event": "exit", "code": <int>}`
- `/logs` never sends an `exit` frame for a healthy device, so `DashboardClient.logs()` is bounded by `max_seconds` / `max_lines` and sets `truncated`.
- ESPHome add-on slugs: `5c53de3b_esphome` (stable), `5c53de3b_esphome-beta`, `5c53de3b_esphome-dev`. Discovery matches the `esphome` substring rather than hard-coding the repo hash.

## HA LLM API contract (verified against HA `helpers/llm.py`)

- `llm.Tool` is a **plain class** — set `name` / `description` / `parameters` (a `vol.Schema`) as **class attributes**; do NOT call `super().__init__`. Implement `async_call(self, hass, tool_input, llm_context) -> dict`. Args are in `tool_input.tool_args`.
- `llm.API` is a `@dataclass(slots=True, kw_only=True)` with `hass`/`id`/`name`; subclass calls `super().__init__(hass=..., id=..., name=...)` and implements `async_get_api_instance` returning an `llm.APIInstance(api, api_prompt, llm_context, tools)`.

## Security invariants (do not weaken)

In `llm.py`: `_sanitize_filename()` rejects `..`, absolute paths, `\`, and empty/`.` path segments; `_guard()` blocks `secrets.yaml`/`secrets.yml` **by basename at any depth** and (for writes/builds) enforces `.yaml`/`.yml`. File tools are always joined under `ESPHOME_CONFIG_DIR` (`/config/esphome`). Supervisor auth uses `os.environ["SUPERVISOR_TOKEN"]` read at call time — never stored.

**Extra file access option** (`CONF_ALLOW_EXTRA_FILES`, default off): a config/options-flow boolean for ESPHome configs that need local C++ in a `components/` directory. When enabled, the read/create/write tools pass `allow_extra=True` to `_guard()`, which (a) permits relative subdirectory paths and (b) lifts the `.yaml`/`.yml` requirement. It does **not** relax anything else: `..`/absolute/secrets are still blocked, and **build tools never pass it** — a configuration to validate/compile/flash is always a top-level YAML file. The effective value is cached in `hass.data[DOMAIN]["allow_extra_files"]` (options override install-time `data`), refreshed live by an `add_update_listener`, and read per-call by `_allow_extra_files()`; the API prompt gains `_EXTRA_FILES_PROMPT` when on. `_write_file()` `makedirs` parent dirs so writes into a new subdir succeed.

## Releasing

The two deliverables version and ship **independently**, each driven by its own git tag prefix. See [PYPI_SETUP.md](PYPI_SETUP.md) for PyPI specifics.

### Tag scheme

| Tag prefix | Example | Ships | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `client-v*` | `client-v0.1.2` | the PyPI client library `esphome-mcp-client` | push of the tag runs `publish.yml` (build → `twine check` → upload, `--skip-existing`) |
| `v*` | `v0.3.5` | the HACS **integration** version | create a **GitHub Release** on the tag; HACS serves it to users |

`client-v*` and `v*` advance on different cadences — a `v*` integration release that doesn't change the transport library needs **no** new `client-v*` tag (it just keeps its existing `manifest.json` pin).

### Cutting a client (PyPI) release

1. Bump `pyproject.toml` `version` **and** `esphome_mcp_client/__init__.py` `__version__` together (they must match — `twine check` and the egg metadata depend on it).
2. Commit, then tag `client-vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. `publish.yml` publishes to PyPI. `--skip-existing` makes a re-run safe.

### Cutting an integration (HACS) release

1. If the integration needs the just-published client, bump the **exact `==` pin** in `custom_components/esphome_mcp_bridge/manifest.json` `requirements` to that client version.
2. Bump the integration `version` in `manifest.json`.
3. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z`, push, and publish a **GitHub Release** on that tag.

Order matters when both change: release the client (`client-v*`) **first** so the version the integration pins already exists on PyPI before users install the new integration.

## Networking caveat

Dashboard traffic is routed through the Supervisor ingress proxy (see `supervisor.py`), so the add-on sees the Supervisor as the TCP peer and its ingress peer guard is satisfied. Session creation (`POST /ingress/session`) requires the caller's `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` to be Home Assistant's own token — true for HA Core, which is where this integration runs. The `dashboard_target_cache` in `llm.py` caches the stable (base_url, ingress_token) per slug; if an add-on is reinstalled its token changes, so a HA restart (which clears the cache) is the recovery path. The direct `hostname:ingress_port` fallback remains for classic dashboards without a peer guard.
